Overview
--------

Runwien.awk is a text-based interface to the WIEN2k FPLAPW calculation
package. This work was born out of the necessity of an easy-to-use,
powerful tool to create large series of similar calculations. Our
primary interest in runwien was to calculate potential energy surfaces
and to perform topological analysis (in the QTAIM sense) of strained
crystals. As a result, the main feature of runwien.awk is its ability
to automatically generate and run extensive sets of similar structures
and analyze the resulting data, with special emphasis in energetic and
topological quantities. Much work has been invested in making
runwien.awk both simple and powerful, allowing the user to create a
host of calculations with just a few input lines, and rendering
collection and analysis of data an easy task. Runwien.awk is intended
to be a complement of w2web web interface, provided with WIEN2k
package. Although runwien.awk does not allow the fine control w2web
does, we feel it can be time-saving for the experienced WIEN2k user.

The main features of runwien.awk are listed below:

* Runwien.awk can generate arbitrarily large sets of cases
  which share structure (cell parameters, atomic types, positions,
  etc.) and differ in some WIEN2k calculation parameter, such as
  RKmax, Rmt,... The information gathered when this
  structures (called general structures) are processed through WIEN2k
  may be used to fine-tune the parameters which will be used in
  further calculations (basis set, etc.). Runwien.awk will run
  automatically all the structures in a sequence and collect the
  information in a synopsis file.

* The user can calculate a wide selection of properties on any (or
  all) of the general structures. 

* Runwien.awk provides new features to obtain properties of the
  calculated systems which improve over the existing in WIEN2k
  interface: elastic constants can be calculated for hexagonal
  systems, density and potential plots can be conveniently generated
  and taylored to the user needs, DOS plots can be arbitrarily
  joined,... Also, in some cases (DOS, density plots,...) the gnuplot
  scripts which generate the output are written so the user can
  customize them to his personal needs. 

* Once the desired parameters are chosen, runwien.awk can create an
  arbitrarily large number of structures to determine the potential
  energy surface of the system. At present, only modification of cell
  parameters within the crystalline system are allowed, but this can
  be attained for any crystal symmetry. This structures (termed
  "sweep" structures) can be calculated sequentially. Most of the
  times, however, the user will want to generate the structures and
  calculate them in parallel (for example using a batch
  system, etc.). The results can then be re-read into runwien.awk and
  the data analyzed as in the one-step process. All the properties
  which can be calculated for general structures can also be obtained
  for sweep structures, allowing the user to explore their evolution
  with crystal geometry.
  
* Runwien.awk is a robust interface. If your calculations go awry
  (because of unexpected termination, errors in input,...), you can
  always load the results back into runwien.awk. Runwien.awk can also
  re-read information from existing case directories, extracting the
  relevant values for analysis. Runwien.awk is "manual-friendly",
  i.e., it will write most of the gnuplot and text files required for
  plots, stdout and stderr from WIEN2k programs, etc.

* Runwien.awk is error-aware. That is, if your job fails, there is a
  possibility that runwien.awk knows what happened. Some user
  experience (mainly from WIEN2k mailing list) has been put in error
  checking, although it is by no means complete, so runwien.awk can
  never be a replacement for human intervention.

* Gathering and analysis of data is simplified in
  runwien.awk. Information about calculated structures can be found on
  "summary" files and in one global "synopsis" file (called
  synopsis.out by default). These summary files encompass a wide
  selection of data, collected directly from output files, such as
  total energy, fermi energy, core/valence states, and many, many
  more. Addition of more information to the synopsis can be done
  easily, and probably more variables will appear in later versions of
  runwien.awk. 

* Runwien.awk is an easy-to-use, natural language interface; yet it is
  powerful enough to generate loads of data with only some lines of
  input. The user can rely on runwien.awk to fill up the calculation
  parameters with sensible default values. In fact, only the
  structural parameters (atomic positions and names, cell
  parameters,...) are needed to initialize a case. It also allows the
  user to load a previous .struct file and a .cif file.

* Finally, runwien.awk is modular and extensible. As you can tell by
  the '.awk' extension, runwien.awk is an AWK script, though a huge
  one, comprising more than 12000 lines of code and more than 60
  additional scripts, all of which sum up to some 15000 code
  lines. Maintenance of a script this large requires the use of some
  special programming techniques. The modularity mentioned above refers to
  runwien.awk organization in sections, each of them independent of
  the rest, which have precise, definite functions. For example, the
  user may calculate the DOS of a system with dosplot section
  (provided required sections were run) and then, calculate the band
  structure with bandplot section, or start off a potential energy
  surface exploration with sweep section. The modularity makes it easy
  to add and remove features and whole sections if required with
  minimal effort. 
  
Installation
------------

Installation of runwien.awk is fairly simple, as no compiling or
linking steps are invovled in the process. The executable files of the
runwien.awk distribution are runwien.awk (found in the root directory)
and a bunch of script files, all with the "lapw" prefix (found under
script/ subdir). To install runwien.awk, make runwien.awk and all the
lapw scripts accesible through your PATH environment variable. 

For example, I keep runwien.awk in my bin/ directory and the lapw
scripts in bin/lapw/. My .bashrc file contains::

	PATH=${PATH}:~/bin/:~/bin/lapw
	export PATH

The LC_NUMERIC environment variable must be set to a locale
that accepts the '.' sign as a decimal separator (e.g. POSIX).

You should check the code block 'user-defined variables' at the
beginning of runwien.awk and tune the variables therein. These
include::

* The WIEN2k version (const_wien2k_version). If your WIEN2k version
  does not match default (release 21.4.2008), you must edit
  runwien.awk and change the value of the variable
  const_wien2k_version.

* Whether the keyword system is allowed (const_allow_system). By
  default, it is not allowed.

* The names of the executables runwien.awk uses (see below). These
  include gnuplot, rename, critic (WIEN2k version), gibbs, some WIEN2k
  executables and the runwien.awk scripts.

* The names of the gnuplot scripts used by 'print' in the sweep
  section (const_gnuplot).

* The names of the data-extracting scripts writing to stdout.

* The names of the summary files created by runwien.awk

The executable file names can include the full path. For instance::

  const_criticexe = "/home/myname/bin/critic"

File names described this way need not to be in the PATH environment
variable. 

Dependencies and required programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Runwien.awk is an interface to WIEN2k. That is, it does not perform
any real calculation (apart from some variable housekeeping). Thus, to
get something done you need some programs which actually do the work:

* gawk (GNU Awk), version 3.1.5 or newer. Gawk is the awk
  interpreter for runwien.awk. Note that runwien.awk will **not**
  work with mawk or original awk. 

* WIEN2k package (http://www.wien2k.at/): the package of programs this
  interface is built for. The installation process of WIEN2k is
  treated elsewhere. Note that in order to run some of the tests
  provided with runwien.awk you will have to increase LMAX2 parameter
  in aim, dstart, lapw0 and lapw2 programs. The reason for this choice
  is our interest in topological analysis: a higher LMAX value
  accounts for a better representation of density inside muffin tins.

* rename, by L. Wall, a perl script which renames files, modified by
  R. Barker to check for the existence of the target files.

* critic, by A. M. Pendás and V. Luaña. Critic finds the critical
  points of the electron density; makes plots of density, laplacian,
  gradient lines,... and integrates basins; all the tasks which are
  necessary for topological analysis (in the QTAIM sense). This
  program is optional, but you will not be able to use the critic
  section if it is not installed.

* gibbs, by M. A. Blanco, E. Francisco and V. Luaña. Applies the
  quasiharmonic debye model to energy and volume static data to the
  calculation of temperature and pressure dependence of thermodynamic
  crystal properties. This program is optional, but you will not be
  able to use the critic section if it is not installed.

* gnuplot by T. Williams, C. Kelley and many others. A plotting
  program (http://www.gnuplot.info).

Support and additional programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some additional programs that may support your work with runwien.awk are: 

* Xcrysden, by A. Kokalj et al. Xcrysden allows fast visualization of
  WIEN2k structures (and other solid-state formats), calculation of
  fermi surfaces, and definition of arbitrary k-paths for spaghetti
  plots, among many other functions (http://www.xcrysden.org/).

* tessel, by V. Luaña. Tessel is a graphical modeller which can be
  used to produce high quality renderings of unit cells, topological
  basin plots and, in general, arbitrary representations in a
  crystalline solid (http://azufre.quimica.uniovi.es).

Runwien.awk tests
-----------------
After the installation, you should run runwien.awk tests to check it
is working. These tests are designed to check every section of the
code, and to portray some of the characteristic features of
runwien.awk. To run them, it usually suffices to cd into the test
directory and run::

	  runwien.awk testxxx.wien

with and optional '>& runwien.out' to redirect the output (for more on
how to run and use runwien.awk, see the user manual).

The time required for running all the tests will vary according to
your computer specifications and your WIEN2k installation, ranging
from minutes to hours.  

Some tests require a special way to be run. These are tests number 019
and 020. The .wien file for these tests is split in two sections,
labelled as 'first pass' and 'second pass'. In a first step, uncomment
the 'first pass' section and execute runwien.awk on the test input
file. Then, comment 'first pass' and uncomment 'second pass'. Finally,
execute runwien.awk on the input file.

Also, in addition to runwien.out and synopsis.out, some tests produce
graphical output (.ps and .eps files) which you may also check.

More information about the test files can be found in the user guide
and in test/test.index.

Known limitations and bugs
--------------------------
The limitations in runwien.awk correspond to our limited scope of
usage of WIEN2k. Nevertheless, if your interests differ from ours (and
most likely will), do not despair: they may be included in subsequent
versions. You can even code them yourself (runwien.awk is, after all,
an AWK script). If you make some useful modification to runwien.awk,
we would be very grateful to hear from it, so we can maybe merge it
with our branch.

The limitations we referred above are:

- There is no support for AFM calculations, FSM calculations,
  spin-orbit interaction or orbital potentials at all. These will most
  certainly be included in later revisions of the code, however.

- Some of the WIEN2k interface programs are not dealt with in
  runwien.awk, which include irrep, lapw3, lapw7, filtvec, telnes.2,
  optimize, elast, optic, joint, kram, fsgen, and most of the
  utility programs in the WIEN2k distribution, with the exception of
  cif2struct. This is a result (as stated above) mainly of lack of
  interest in these properties. Some of them (like optimize, elast,
  dosplot,...) are superseded by the features of runwien.awk. The
  interface for mini is severely underdeveloped as of this version. 

If you find a bug in runwien.awk, please, tell us about. We will
modify the code as soon as possible.

Compatibility with different WIEN2k versions. Portability
---------------------------------------------------------
Runwien.awk has been checked thoroughly only for WIEN2k, with
versions: 

- WIEN2k_06.4 (Release 24/8/2006) 
- WIEN2k_07.2 (Release 20/2/2007)
- WIEN2k_08.2 (Release 21/4/2008)
- WIEN2k_08.3 (Release 18/9/2008)

It is likely that it will run in versions which lay in between
these. However, if you find problems with later or previous versions,
please, let us know about it. 

By default, runwien.awk is set up for the latest compatible version we
are using. If you have another version of WIEN2k, change the
const_wien2k_version variable at the beginning of runwien.awk to the
appropriate value (yyyy-mm-dd of the release)::

  # wien2k version
  const_wien2k_version = 20080918
  # const_wien2k_version = 20080421
  # const_wien2k_version = 20070220
  # const_wien2k_version = 20060824

Runwien.awk runs under GNU/Linux operative system. The distribution we
used for the tests is debian (etch).
